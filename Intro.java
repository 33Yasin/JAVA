        //Java is a programming language originally developed
        //by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems.
        //It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
        //Java slogan “write once, run everywhere”

        //Properties of Java Programming Language
        //Simple
        //High-performance
        //Object-oriented
        //Network capable
        //Interpreted and compiled
        //Multi-threaded
        //Robust
        //Secure
        //Dynamic

        //Java is Case-Sensitive
        //Yourname, yourname, yourName, YourName
        //These are four different identifiers

        // Conventions:
        // Package: all lower case  -> theexample
        // Class: initial upper case, composite words with upper case -> TheExample
        // Method/field: initial lower, composite words with upper case -> theExample
        // Constants: all upper case -> THE_EXAMPLE


        //Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
        //It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
        //It has a large demand in the current job market
        //It is easy to learn and simple to use
        //It is open-source and free
        //It is secure, fast and powerful
        //It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
        //Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure
        // to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs


        //Inside the main() method,
        // we can use the println() method to print a line of text
        // to the screen:
        System.out.println(5);

        //You can also perform mathematical calculations
        //inside the println() method:
        System.out.println(3 * 9);

        //When you are working with text,
        // it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
